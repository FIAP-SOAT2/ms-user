# USER MICROSERVICE

> User microservice for snack bar order management system.


## What I need?

With this structure, your environment will have everything you need to build a project:

- Node, docker and docker-compose

## Running the application directly on your local machine

You can use these commands to start the application:

- `docker build -t order . --no-cache`
- `docker-compose up -d --force-recreate`

Docker-compose is set to start an instance of Postgres and the entire application.

- `npm run build`: builds app.
- `npm run start`: start the server.
- `npm run dev`: start the server in development mode.

## Project architecture

This project was built using Clean Architecture and SOLID principles.

To separate concerns, the application was built with a Clean Architecture. It is divided into Domain, Application, Infra and Main layers.

### Domain Layer

The Domain layer contains the Entitites and it is in charge of the business logic of the application.

### Application Layer
The Application Layer implements all the use cases and contains the interfaces to interact with the outside world.

### Infra Layer
The Infra Layer contains the controllers, database connections, repositories, that is, this layer has the concrete implementations of the application.


### Main Layer
The Main Layer is the entry point of the application. It contains the framework (Express), the routes, the factory method to inject the necessary dependencies.
